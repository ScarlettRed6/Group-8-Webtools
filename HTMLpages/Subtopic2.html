            <h2> How to protect yourself from CyberAttacks?</h2>
            <pre>
                1. Use Strong and Unique Passwords:

                >Create complex passwords using a combination of letters, numbers, and special characters.
                >Avoid using easily guessable information like birthdays or common words.
                >Use a different password for each of your accounts.

                2. Enable Two-Factor Authentication (2FA):

                >Enable 2FA whenever possible to add an extra layer of security.
                >This typically involves receiving a code on your phone or another device in addition to entering your password.

                3. Keep Software and Operating Systems Updated:

                >Regularly update your operating system, software, and antivirus programs.
                >Updates often include security patches that help protect your system from known vulnerabilities.

                4. Use a Reliable Antivirus and Anti-Malware Software:

                >Install reputable antivirus and anti-malware software and keep it up to date.
                >Run regular scans to detect and remove any malicious software.

                5. Be Cautious with Emails and Links:
