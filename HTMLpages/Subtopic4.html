            <h2>What is Insider Threat?</h2>
            <pre>
                Insider threats are a branch of data breach that occurs when there is a security threat 
                that originates from within the targeted organization. This threat typically involves 
                authorized users within the organization who have access to sensitive information from 
                an account. It could be employees, contractors, or business owners who intentionally or 
                accidentally misuse their access. In some incidents, cybercriminals are the ones who 
                hijacked the system.

                Insider threats, whether intentional or the product of carelessness, can be more harmful 
                and expensive than external threats, which are more frequent and make the most news when 
                it comes to cyberattacks. Data breaches started by malicious insiders were the most 
                expensive, averaging USD 4.90 million, or 9.5 percent more than the average data breach 
                cost of USD 4.45 million, according to IBM's Cost of a Data Breach Report 2023. 
                Additionally, according to a recent Verizon report, cases involving insider attackers 
                have exposed at least one billion records, compared to the average external threat's 200 
                million stolen records.

            <h2>Types of insider threats:</h2>
            <pre>
                Malicious Insider - The term "turncloak" refers to those who deliberately and maliciously 
                misuse official information, abuse it, or steal information for their own financial or 
                personal benefit. Usually, they are current workers or former workers with vengeful motives 
                whose login credentials haven't been seized. In other cases, certain malicious insiders 
                "work" for a third party in order to purposefully disrupt internal organization activities, 
                leak confidential information, or exchange or sell sensitive data. For example, if a 
                manager harbors deep resentment toward an employee, this malicious insider may misuse their 
                access to the employee's private information in order to seek revenge.

                Negligent Insiders - It is an innocent pawn with no malicious intent, but because of its 
                negligence, it unintentionally leaves the system vulnerable to outside threats. This 
                careless insider might fall victim to a phishing scam, bypass security protocols, misplace a 
                laptop that contains data and has access to the organization's network, or transmit incorrect 
                files to someone outside the company that contain sensitive data. For instance, a staff member 
                might accidentally click on a dangerous link, which would then allow malware to attack the 
                company's computer system.

                Mole - an imposter who is technically an outsider but has managed to gain access to the system or 
                network of the organization. This is someone who pretends to be a member of the organization and 
                abuses sensitive information.
